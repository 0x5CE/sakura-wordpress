== Description ==

**WE FACILITATE DIGITAL NETWORKING AND CO-OPERATION**

Our concept is very simple: If players team up and shuffle traffic between each other in a defined network they will gain more traffic all together.
Cooperating in networks will increase exposure, traffic and sales for every member..
Sakura facilitates building curated digital networks of cooperation and we also help members connect to established networks in Sakura.
Sakuras value proposition is built on Nordic Democratic values: we share, we work together, we cooperate. We believe the future is all about co-opetition.

In the search field type “Sakura,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us,  you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by! Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

Manual installation method requires downloading the Sakura network plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we still recommend you back up your site.

If you encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update, flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting “Save.” That should return things to normal.
